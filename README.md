Contained in this repository are the files used in the calculation to check for the integrability of the Green-Schwarz superstring in various dimensions.  All the files are complete, however the 10D code to check for integrability is incomplete due to lack of computational power, however the general proof in the paper still stands. 

Credit to Matthew Headrick for his grassmann.m Mathematica package to deal with skew symmetric algebra.
